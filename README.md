# paycheck-architecture

This repository provides a place for contributors to propose ideas, collaborate, and build a community for design proposals. Architectural decisions are updated as `markdown` files, diagrams such as state, service, information flow, or UML diagrams. 

Inspired by the [Rust RFC process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs) (Request For Comments), which itself takes inspiration from the [Python PEP process](https://peps.python.org/). Contributions of all forms are welcome. We are also attributing special credits to Zulip, for template style
